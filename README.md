ripple-client-gtk
=================

Payment client for the ripple finacial network


This program is in early development. It's not ready for use and is insecure. Namely it sends password in plaintext to the server on submit. 
If you want to test this program you must set up a local rippled server and connect to the local server via ssl

example in networking

wss://localhost:433
